# Web Scraping from Wikipedia
We want to scrape some useful information about movies (genre, actors, duration).

You basically need a list of movie title (here in Excel file).
Please, be aware that the title name must be equal to the title in the Wiki page. 
For instance, for the movie "The Wrestler" you need to write ""The Wrestler (2008 film)" since the url is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrestler_(2008_film).
